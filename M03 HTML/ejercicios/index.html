        <h2>A brief history of the Cainite race:</h2>
        <h3>Caine</h3>
        <img src="./img/caine.jpg"/>
        <p>To understand the race of the Cainites, one must first underst what they are and where they come from. The basic, accepted
            genealogy of the Cainites is as follows: Caine begat three childer.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ynosh</li>
            <li>Irad</li>
            <li>Zillah</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Second Generation</h3>
        <p>Although much has been said about Caine and His Grandchilder, little information is known about Caine's direct childer.
            We do know they were embraced in the following order:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ynosh</li>
            <li>Irad</li>
            <li>Zillah</li>
        </ol>
        <span>There is also the issue about which members of the 2nd Generation begat which Antediluvian.</span>
        <span>For example. The Tzimiske Antediluvian is thought to have been embraced by Ynosh, but most high clans claim the same,</span>
        <span>so we can infer from this that "Ynosh" was thought of as the "first among equals", probably due to being the Eldest 
            childe of Caine.
