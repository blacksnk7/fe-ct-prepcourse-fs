HTML:
    -A button inside a form will always reload the page, sending all of the information inside the form somewhere else.
    
CSS:
    -CSS has a class hierarchy. It goes:
        1) body (or other tag inherent to HTML such as "head", "header, "main", etc.)
        2) class (must be set in the html section with the class="name" descriptor. Different elements inside the HTML file may belong to the same class)
        3) id (must be set in the html section with the id="name" descriptor. Id's should refer to a single element inside the HTML file)
    -Important notations:
        -ew: 1 ew is equal to the space occupied by a single line in the default font used by HTML.
        -vw: "view width" is equal to the % of the screen used. So 100vw equals the entirety of the screen.
    -Padding: if it has a single value then said value is taken for each cardinal point (2em = 2em up, 2em right, 2em down and 2em left)

JS:
    -You can add a string to a number and it will automatically convert it into a string.
